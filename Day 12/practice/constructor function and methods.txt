//contstructor function
function Hello(name,age,city)
    {
     this.name=name;	//this.keyword is used assign the variable names with the arguments of function.
        this.age=age;
        this.city=city;
}

//initializing a constructor function

if you want to just make a variable with different properties at once, we will use constructor function, and to call it
we will do the following steps.

	var todd=new Hello("go",1,"foor"); //initializing the variable todd by calling the function and entering the data.

//as e.g if we want to know name of var toddd, we will just do the following step for the same.

	console.log(todd.city);

//output: foor 


//Method 
//now creating a method

this.movie=function(){	//this. keyword is used to make the method, where the method is set with an anonymous function.
alert("hello");
}

//initializing the method;
var callme=new Hello("going",1,"for");

//calling the method to display alert
callme.movie(); //this function will display alert on the browser wiz "hello"
